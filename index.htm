		<p  style="color:green;"><b>Humans use to avoid passing through the jungle, but for some it was the only way to their villages. One day, a woodcutter was passing through the jungle and after walking for hours, he was tired and thought of taking a quick nap under a huge banyan tree. While he was sleeping, a troop of monkeys came and took the bag he was carrying. When the woodcutter saw the monkeys taking <br> away his bag, he realized that he had to do something quickly! Just in time he remembered what his forefathers had told him."Whenever monkeys steal something from you, throw something at the monkeys!They will try to imitate you, and will throw back whatever they have in their hands."So the woodcutter started throwing stones at the monkeys. Seeing this the monkey tried to copy the man and started throwing whatever they could gather and in the process also threw woodcutter’s bag. The man thanked his forefathers, took his bag and went back smiling to his village.</b></p>

		<p style="color:darkred;"><b>The sun has gone down from the sky and it is no longer in sight the moon is however and it is more beautiful than ever, it’s fullness is amazing I have never seen it so beautiful the light gently massages my face and the craters make me wonder what it would be like to live on the moon. The stars surrounding the moon are more wonderful than I can remember and they sparkle so beautifully shining in the sky like a beautiful diamond necklace making the moon stand out more than ever, this is the most amazing sight that I have ever seen I has been set in my mind forever. This is why I love the sunset because it is an amazing sight and then what follows afterwards is another breathtaking sight. Everything is so peaceful at night everything is calm and still.</b></p>
